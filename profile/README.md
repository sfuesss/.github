# Welcome to ESSS 👋 - Engineering Science Student Society 🎓

At the heart of Simon Fraser University's School of Engineering Science lies the Engineering Science Student Society (ESSS). Our mission is to serve and advocate for the interests of our members, not only within the confines of the university but extending out to the broader industry and other engineering societies. 🌐

## Student-Driven, Community-Focused 🤝

Run entirely by a dedicated group of students, ESSS is the embodiment of school spirit and community within the Engineering Science department. We believe in the power of connection, and through various initiatives, we aim to bridge the gap between students, faculty, staff, and the industry. 💡

## Events, Conferences, and More 🎉

Throughout the academic year, ESSS hosts a myriad of social events to foster camaraderie among students. We also take pride in organizing career fairs, offering a platform for students to explore potential career paths and network with industry professionals. Our members also have the opportunity to represent the society at esteemed conferences such as the Western Engineering Competition and the Canadian Engineering Competition. 🏆
